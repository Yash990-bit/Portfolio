This project demonstrates an interactive website with smooth scrolling, toggleable content, popups for services, a contact form, and a mobile-friendly navigation menu. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance user experience.

# Features
Toggleable Content: "Read More" and "Read Less" functionality to toggle content visibility.
Service Popups: Detailed service descriptions appear in a popup when clicking the "Read More" button in each service box.
Form Submission: A contact form that validates user input and displays a success message after submission.
Hamburger Menu: A mobile-friendly menu that appears on smaller screens.
Smooth Scrolling: Smooth scrolling navigation for quick access to page sections.
Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes, including mobile devices.
Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure of the website.
CSS: For styling, including animations, layout, and responsiveness.
JavaScript: Handles user interactions, such as toggling content, opening popups, and form submissions.

Fonts: The website uses the Nunito font, imported from Google Fonts.
General Styles: Includes padding, margin resets, and a smooth scroll behavior.
Animations: Several CSS keyframes are used to create smooth animations for elements like logos, navigation links, and service boxes.
Responsive Layout: Media queries are used to ensure the website adjusts properly for smaller screens, such as phones and tablets.

Toggleable Content: Clicking on the "Read More" button toggles the display of extra content in the .city-content section.
Popup Display: When the "Read More" button is clicked in a .services-box, a popup appears with more detailed content. The popup can be closed with a close button.
Contact Form Handling: When the contact form is submitted, it checks that all fields are filled out before displaying a success message.
Menu Toggle: The hamburger icon toggles the visibility of the navigation menu on smaller screens.
Smooth Scrolling: Clicking on a link in the navigation bar smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section.
